        " Nontes for section 16. Equations of Planes in Space## 1. Equation of a Plane Passing Through Three PointsIf the plane passes through points $A(x_1, y_1, z_1)$, $B(x_2, y_2, z_2)$, and $C(x_3, y_3, z_3)$, the equation is:1. Find two vectors:   $$   \\vec{AB} = \\langle x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1, z_2 - z_1 \\rangle, \\quad \\vec{AC} = \\langle x_3 - x_1, y_3 - y_1, z_3 - z_1 \\rangle   $$2. Compute the normal vector:   $$   \\vec{n} = \\vec{AB} \\times \\vec{AC}   $$3. Write the plane equation:   $$   A(x - x_1) + B(y - y_1) + C(z - z_1) = 0   $$   where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are the components of $\\vec{n}$.---## 2. Equation of a Plane Parallel to Another PlaneIf a plane passes through a point $A(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and is parallel to the plane $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0$, its equation is:$$A(x - x_1) + B(y - y_1) + C(z - z_1) = 0$$or equivalently:$$Ax + By + Cz + D' = 0$$where $D' = -(Ax_1 + By_1 + Cz_1)$.---## 3. Equation of a Plane Perpendicular to a Given Normal VectorIf the plane passes through point $A(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and is perpendicular to the normal vector $\\mathbf{n} = [A, B, C]$, the equation is:$$A(x - x_1) + B(y - y_1) + C(z - z_1) = 0$$---## 4. Line of Intersection of Two PlanesFor two planes $A_1x + B_1y + C_1z + D_1 = 0$ and $A_2x + B_2y + C_2z + D_2 = 0$, the line of intersection can be found as follows:1. Solve the system of equations to find a point on the line.2. Compute the direction vector of the line as:   $$   \\vec{d} = \\vec{n_1} \\times \\vec{n_2}   $$   where $\\vec{n_1} = [A_1, B_1, C_1]$ and $\\vec{n_2} = [A_2, B_2, C_2]$.The parametric equation of the line is:$$\\vec{r}(t) = \\vec{r_0} + t\\vec{d}$$where $\\vec{r_0}$ is the point on the line.---## 5. Plane Passing Through a Point and Parallel to Two VectorsIf the plane passes through point $A(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and is parallel to vectors $\\vec{v_1} = [v_{1x}, v_{1y}, v_{1z}]$ and $\\vec{v_2} = [v_{2x}, v_{2y}, v_{2z}]$, the normal vector is:$$\\vec{n} = \\vec{v_1} \\times \\vec{v_2}$$The equation of the plane is:$$A(x - x_1) + B(y - y_1) + C(z - z_1) = 0$$---## 6. Parallel and Perpendicular Planes- A plane **parallel** to $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0$ has the same normal vector $\\vec{n} = [A, B, C]$ but a different $D'$.- A plane **perpendicular** to it has a normal vector orthogonal to $\\vec{n}$.---## 7. Distance from a Point to a PlaneThe distance $d$ from a point $P(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ to a plane $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0$ is:$$d = \\frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + Cz_0 + D|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}}$$---## 8. Equation of a Plane from InterceptsIf a plane intersects the coordinate axes at points $A(a, 0, 0)$, $B(0, b, 0)$, and $C(0, 0, c)$, its equation is:$$\\frac{x}{a} + \\frac{y}{b} + \\frac{z}{c} = 1$$---## 9. Angle Between Two PlanesThe angle $\\theta$ between two planes $A_1x + B_1y + C_1z + D_1 = 0$ and $A_2x + B_2y + C_2z + D_2 = 0$ is:$$\\cos\\theta = \\frac{|A_1A_2 + B_1B_2 + C_1C_2|}{\\sqrt{A_1^2 + B_1^2 + C_1^2} \\sqrt{A_2^2 + B_2^2 + C_2^2}}$$---## 10. Vector Perpendicular to a PlaneThe vector perpendicular to the plane $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0$ is simply:$$\\vec{n} = [A, B, C]$$"
