        "The equation $y'(x) = y(x)$$y'(x) = y(x)$ means that the rate of change of the function $y(x)$$y(x)$ with respect to $x$$x$ is equal to the function itself. Our goal is to find a function $y(x)$$y(x)$ that satisfies this condition.\n",

        "The integrals are straightforward: $\\ln|y| = x + C$ (where C is the constant of integration)\n",
        "Solving for y:\n",
        "\n",
        "Exponentiate both sides to solve for $y$$y$: $|y| = e^{x + C}$ $|y| = e^x \\cdot e^C$ Since $e^C$ is just another constant, we can rewrite it as $A$: $|y| = Ae^x$\n",
        "To remove the absolute value, we introduce another constant, which can be either positive or negative. We can represent this by writing: $y = ke^x$ (where $k$ is a constant that can be positive or negative, or zero if $A = 0$)\n",
        "Therefore, the general solution to the differential equation $y'(x) = y(x)$$y'(x) = y(x)$ is $y(x) = ke^x$$y(x) = ke^x$, where $k$$k$ is an arbitrary constant.\n",
